PART IV. RADIO OR TRANSPONDER FAILURE: 

1. Any person operating an aircraft under VFR within the DC SFRA who becomes aware of an inability to comply with the requirement to maintain radio contact with ATC shall immediately change the transponder code to 7600 and exit the DC SFRA by the most direct lateral route or if the aircraft departure point is closer, return to the departure point by the most direct route. These procedures do not authorize penetration of restricted or prohibited airspace. 
2. Any person operating an aircraft under IFR within the DC SFRA who becomes aware of an inability to comply with the requirement to maintain radio contact with ATC shall continue the flight via the two-way radio communications failure procedures found in the FAA Aeronautical Information Manual. These procedures do not authorize penetration of restricted or prohibited airspace.
